# Duneauth Plugin for DokuWiki

Implements a DokuWiki Auth plugin backed by the DUNE LPC AUTHD's SQLite
database. This allows users to log into the wiki using their in-game
credentials.

## Requirements

Requires PHP support for SQLite.

If you're using Ubuntu 20.04 with PHP 7.4 this likely means you need to `apt-get
install php7.4-sqlite` (don't forget to restart your webserver after you
install it).
